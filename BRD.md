# Business Requirements Document (BRD): Image Compressor

## 1.0 Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview

The project aims to develop a comprehensive image compression solution that can be utilized as a library, a web application, and a web API. The core functionality will be to compress images to modern, efficient formats like AVIF and WebP.

### 1.2 Goals and Objectives

- To create a high-performance image compression library in .NET 9.
- To provide a user-friendly web application for easy image compression.
- To expose the compression functionality through a web API for integration with other services.

## 2.0 Project Phases

The project will be developed in three distinct phases:

### 2.1 Phase 1: Image Compression Library

Develop a .NET 9 library that can compress an image from a given URL. The library will allow specifying the output format (AVIF or WebP), width, and quality of the compressed image.

### 2.2 Phase 2: Web Application

Create a web application that utilizes the image compression library. The web application will provide a user interface for uploading or specifying an image URL, selecting compression options, and downloading the compressed image.

### 2.3 Phase 3: Web API

Develop a web API that exposes the functionality of the image compression library. This will allow other developers and teams to integrate the image compression service into their own applications.

## 3.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Phase 1: Image Compression Library

- The library must be written in .NET 9.
- The library must accept the following parameters:
    - Image URL (string)
    - Output format (string: "avif" or "webp")
    - Width (integer)
    - Quality (integer: 0-100)
- The library must download the image from the provided URL.
- The library must resize the image to the specified width, maintaining the aspect ratio.
- The library must compress the image to the specified format and quality.
- The library must return the compressed image data as a byte array or stream.

### 3.2 Phase 2: Web Application (High-Level)

- The web application will have a user interface to:
    - Enter an image URL.
    - Select the output format (AVIF or WebP).
    - Specify the desired width.
    - Choose the compression quality.
- The web application will display the compressed image.
- The web application will allow the user to download the compressed image.

### 3.3 Phase 3: Web API (High-Level)

- The API will have an endpoint to accept image compression requests.
- The API request will include the image URL, output format, width, and quality.
- The API will return the compressed image in the response.

## 4.0 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The image compression process should be fast and efficient.
- **Scalability:** The web application and API should be able to handle multiple concurrent requests.
- **Usability:** The library, web application, and API should be well-documented and easy to use.

## 5.0 Scope

### 5.1 In Scope

- Development of the .NET 9 image compression library.
- Development of the web application.
- Development of the web API.

### 5.2 Out of Scope

- User authentication and authorization for the web application and API (initially).
- Support for image formats other than those supported by the underlying .NET libraries.
- Advanced image manipulation features beyond resizing and compression.

## 6.0 Assumptions and Constraints

### 6.1 Assumptions

- A .NET 9 development environment is available and properly configured.
- The necessary image processing libraries for .NET 9 are available and can be integrated.

### 6.2 Constraints

- The core compression library must be developed using .NET 9.
